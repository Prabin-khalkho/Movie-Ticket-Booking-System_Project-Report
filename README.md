# Movie-Ticket-Booking-System_Project-Report
The Movie Ticket Booking System is a console-based mini project built using C language, designed to automate the movie ticket booking process. It efficiently manages movie listings, seat allocations, bookings, and cancellations while demonstrating the use of arrays, structures, loops, and functions in C.

🚀 Features

Display available movies and show timings
View and select available seats
Book tickets and generate booking details
Cancel booked tickets
Maintain seat availability dynamically

🧠 Project Objective

To design and implement a simple yet efficient system for booking and managing movie tickets using basic C programming concepts like arrays and structures.
⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: C
IDE: Code::Blocks / Dev-C++ / Turbo C
Platform: Windows / Linux

💻 System Requirements
